> Project 3

FoodieFind is a full-stack restaurant discovery and review platform that allows users to explore restaurants, write reviews, and receive personalized recommendations based on their taste preferences. Designed for food lovers who enjoy trying new places, the app combines user-generated content with backend logic to surface meaningful, location-based suggestions.

Users can filter restaurants by cuisine, location, and price, save their favorites, and track their dining experiences. Personalized suggestions are generated based on user profiles, past interactions, and ratings, mimicking real-world food recommendation platforms.
