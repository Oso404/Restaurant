main.jsx is our "rendering" file...in other words it takes in react objects and transforms them into html/css so that we can see them on screen

in this project we choose the root element to be the starting point  where react objects are to be loaded

jsx file can return just one object and this object can contain many html elements within a div to be returned or it can return just one element

jsx file is not allowed to return more than one object....if we the user wish to return more than one theyd have to be wrapped using a div

in order to use element created in a jsx file they must be exported within that very jsx file and imported in different file where its to be used

margin vs padding
margin is space between div and anything around it whereas padding is space between div and inside 

if we want curved divs on edges we use border radius and set to a percentage    

position attribute
controls how an element is positioned within the document and how it should behave with its nearby elements

if we want to align some things we would use the display css attribute and assign it to flex...this allows us to to easily control how elements align, space out and wrap
